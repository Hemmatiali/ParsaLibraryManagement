# Parsa Library Management

## Introduction
Welcome to the Parsa Library Management project, an open-source initiative for creating a comprehensive library management system. This project is currently under construction and is being developed with a focus on robustness, scalability, and the latest technological standards.

### Technologies
This project is being built using a range of modern technologies and architectural approaches, including:
- **Clean Architecture**: Ensuring a scalable, maintainable, and testable codebase.
- **.NET 8 & C# MVC**: Utilizing the latest .NET framework for robust back-end development.
- **SQL Server**: For reliable and efficient database management.
- **EntityFramework Core & Code First**: ORM for .NET, enabling a code-centric database approach.
- **FluentValidation**: For advanced data validation.
- **AutoMapper**: To simplify object-to-object mappings.
- **ImageSharp**: For handling image processing tasks.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Ensuring a domain-focused design approach.
- **Generic Repository Pattern**: Abstracting data access to enhance maintainability.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Ensuring code reliability and quality.
- **xUnit**: For comprehensive unit testing.

## Project Status
The project is actively being developed, with new features and improvements being added regularly. While it currently focuses on managing books, book categories, and related entities, the scope is set to expand to encompass a wide range of library management functionalities.
